# Shortest-Path-Algorithms
This Contains Djkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree

Problem 1: Single-source Shortest Path Algorithm
Find shortest path tree in both directed and undirected weighted graphs for a given source vertex. Assume there is no negative edge in your graph. You will print each path and path cost for a given source.

Problem 2: Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm
Given a connected, undirected, weighted graph, find a spanning tree using edges that minimizes the total weight w(T)=∑(u,v)∈Tw(u,v). Use either Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm to find Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). You will printout edges of the tree and total cost of minimum spanning tree.

Djkstra_inputs, Kruskal input folders have directed and undirected graph inputs to run.
